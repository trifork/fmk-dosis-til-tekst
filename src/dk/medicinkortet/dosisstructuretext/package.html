The classes in this package and it's sub packages implements the core functionality for converting structured 
dosages used in the the common medicine card project ("Det f&aelig;lles medicinkort") to text

. 
 
<!-- Text above goes into the header (the dot breaks) -->

The structures dosages, in XML form, are converted to:

<ul>
	<li>
		Long text. 
	</li>
	<li> 
		Short text. This is only supported for a limited number of dosage structures. The goal is to be able 
		to convert the majority of the structured dosages for dosages given in the Danish Medicines Agency's 
		pricelist ("Taksten"). 
	</li>
	<li>
		Average daily dosage. The average daily dosage is calculated for structured dosages with exception of 
		dosages according to need and dosages not given on spcific days (where DosageDayIdentifier is 0). 
		Note that is not allowed to alter the dosage in the free text, but this cannot be validated for.
	</li>
</ul>

The Test class in this package shows an example of how this converter can be used. See <a href="Test.html">the Test 
class</a> for further information.
<p/>
This is part of the dosisstructure module.
